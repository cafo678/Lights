Starting from a very basic project of the course, I've built my version of "Escape" taking the 2 simple mechanichs of grabbing and releasing an object through an handle component and using trigger volumes to cause overlap events. I’ve expanded them to build a puzzle game. I’ve also introduced few narrative elements.
